NZ Post Developer Coding Task

The task is to find the shortest path (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) between two nodes in a graph, chosen by the user. The easiest way to do that is using Djikstra's algorithm. I will use JAVA to do that as it is the language that I'm more used to.
